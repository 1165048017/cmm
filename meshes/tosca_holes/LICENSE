This directory contains derivations of 3D shape models from TOSCA dataset.
These models have been modified with mesh editing software to contain artificial holes.

Tosca hi-resolution 3D database v 1.0
http://tosca.cs.technion.ac.il/book/resources_data.html
(c) Alexander & Michael Bronstein, 2006-2009

DESCRIPTION:

Hi-resolution three-dimensional nonrigid shapes in a variety of poses 
for non-rigid shape similarity and correspondence experiments. The database 
contains a total of 80 objects, including 11 cats, 9 dogs, 3 wolves, 8 horses,
4 gorillas, 12 female figures, and two different male figures, containing 7 
and 20 poses. The database also contains 6 centaurs for partial similarity 
experiments. Objects within the same class have the same triangulation and an 
equal number of vertices numbered in a compatible way. This can be used as
a per-vertex ground truth correspondence in correspondence experiments.
Two representations are available: MATLAB file (.mat) and ASCII text files 
containing the 1-based list of triangular faces (.tri), and a list of vertex 
XYZ coordinates (.vert). A .png thumbnail is available for each object.
